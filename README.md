This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
